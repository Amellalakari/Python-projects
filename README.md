# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning  
This project predicts heart disease using Logistic Regression in Python.

## 🚀 Features:
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, categorical encoding)
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Saving & deploying the model for predictions

## 📁 Files in this Repo:
- `Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full code.
- `Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv` – Dataset used for training.
- `heart_disease_model.pkl` – Trained model (optional).
- `README.md` – Project overview.

## 📌 How to Run:
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aishwaryamellalakari/heart-disease-prediction.git
